## Meme Generator - Part 6

### Decription:

When a user clicks on a thumbnail visible to user in the javascript flexslider, it will copy the larger image to the div allowing them to create the meme by adding text.

### Overview

Using the code from [HERE](https://github.com/rugbyprof/5373-Internet-Programming/tree/master/Lectures/L08) add the following functionality:

1. A user can click on a thumbnail in the flexslider grid.
2. The actual image from the server will be copied to the main meme edit area.
3. If the user doesnt want to use a thumbnail, than they can paste a url in a text box, and that image (as long as it is a valid url to an image) will show up in the meme editor area.
4. The saved meme, will be represented in the database, and the file will exist on disk on your server.
