## Final Project
### Due: Finals Week

### Candy Store Site

This assignment will encompass everything we have learned up until now with a few additions. We will be constructing a fake online candy store gives users the ability to: 

- Register
- Login
- Search for products
- Add items to shopping cart
- Order Items
- Process credit card

### Part 1

- Group
- Register with Stripe
- Find a theme (preferably boostrap)

### Part 2

- Purchase a domain name: https://www.namecheap.com/
- Point your new domain name to your server: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9837/46/how-to-connect-a-domain-name-to-a-hosting-account-or-a-server
- Add Secure Socket Layer so we can serve HTTPS pages: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-apache-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-16-04

### Part3

So far we have brain stormed on what content and functionality we need to get going. In order to acheive our goal of a somewhat complete ecommerce solution for fake candy, we need to get going on functionality. So we need to start writing some routes to handle events like registration, logging in, searching, etc, but we don't have the necessary DB tables to handle this. 

Routes:

- login (possible help: https://daveismyname.blog/login-and-registration-system-with-php)
- register
- browse with pagination
- search
- categories
- menu items
