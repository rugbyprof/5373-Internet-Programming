## Meme Generator - Presentations
### Due: April 10<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>

- You are going to organize projects 1-6 into a presentation.
- The look of your web pages is not important, however organized looking pages are.
- Your presentation will consist of basically two components:
    - Demonstrating the front end functionality
    - Showing the results on the server
    - (e.g. upload an image, show the image on the server and in the database)
- What will you present? Really just three pages:
    - Upload an image.
    - Make a meme.
    - Generated memes.
- Everything else, like clean urls, I'll look at seperately.

#### Uploading

- Your image upload page will place all necessary information in the DB, and save the image to the server.
- Your Meme page will display uploaded images in slider (with previously uploaded images) and allow user to (basically part 6):
    - click on thumbnail to place it in the meme editor.
    - use a url to put image in meme editor.
    - same the meme, and display the results.
- The last page will display all generated memes in a grid style format. 


#### Page Style

I would like to see a toolbar with:
    - Upload
    - Generate 
    - View 
    
to allow us to navigate to each page. I can discuss a little bit about how to achieve this.
