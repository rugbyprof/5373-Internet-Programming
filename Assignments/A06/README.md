## Meme Generator - Presentations
### Due: April 10<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>

- You are going to organize projects 1-6 into a presentation.
- The look and style of your web pages is not important, however having organized pages is important. Basically it doesn't have to look cool, it needs to look like there was effort in the layout.
- Your presentation will consist of basically two components:
    - Demonstrating the front end functionality.
    - Showing the results on the server.
    - (e.g. upload an image, show the image on the server and in the database)
- What will you present? Really just three pages:
    - Uploading an image.
    - Makeing a meme.
    - Generated memes.
- Everything else, like clean urls, I'll look at seperately.

#### Uploading

- Your upload page will have an upload form (button) that allows a user to upload an image to the server.
- You will demonstrate uploading an image, and then show the class the results in your DB and on disk.

#### Meme
- Your Meme page will display uploaded images in the flex slider (with previously uploaded images) and allow user to:
    - click on thumbnail to place it in the meme editor.
    - use a url to put image in meme editor.
    - save the meme, and display the resulting meme below the form.
- You will then show the class your meme text is saved in the DB table and show your saved meme on disk.
    
#### All Memes
- The last page will display all generated memes in a grid style format. Thats it. 

#### Extra Credit
- Change fonts and colors on meme however you like.

#### Main Page for Demonstrating. 

I would like to see a toolbar with:
    - Upload
    - Generate 
    - View 
    
to allow us to navigate to each page. I can discuss a little bit about how to achieve this.
