## Files 2 Database - Reading data from a file into a relational database.

## Site Content

Our approach to learning internet programming is a little different. You might think we need to learn some HTML and some Javascript so we can start laying out a site. I say we need a little knowlegde of how the backend works, to include basic linux commands, an intro to our scripting language (PHP) and also an intro to our database Mysql (MariaDB). We have looked at both linux and some PHP (and will continue to expand on both) and now we need to get introduced to our database.
